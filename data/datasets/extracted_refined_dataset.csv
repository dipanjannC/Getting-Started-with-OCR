You'll note that references to ""personal.monitoring studies"" have been deleted. It seems a technical point to explain how.the actual exposure data are obtained, and a white paper is available elsewhere.in the binder to elaborate..* The section on respiratory effects has been consolidated, providing one for.alleged effects on adults and another for alleged effects on children. And the.asthma arguments which were previously a third section are now placed under.the adult and children sections..* The original Science and Public Policy section remains unchanged. But an.alternative version is suggested at the conclusion. The title suggests a discussion py.about the broader issue of how science in general, not just ETS, and public policy = G.interact rather than further discussion about how ETS science should be 3.evaluated more carefully by scientists and policy makers.

Given all of the edits to both the first and.second drafts which have been requested it seemed only fair to try to.incorporate those comments and others provided subsequently and offer you an.amended version harmonizing all the recommendations for your consideration.Wherever possible the revised edition adheres to the spirit and letter of the.original. Following are some of the structural changes.Anew opening Overview sequence of messages is suggested using those.already cited throughout the document. These are placed at the beginning to.offer top line messages which may be supported in subsequent sections. References to exposure study research has been moved up to the Overview.section as have the other arguments which seem related to the underlying.weaknesses of the ETS science. Youll note that references to personal.monitoring studies have been deleted. It seems a technical point to explain how.the actual exposure data are obtained and a white paper is available elsewhere.in the binder to elaborate. The section on respiratory effects has been consolidated providing one for.alleged effects on adults and another for alleged effects on children. And the.asthma arguments which were previously a third section are now placed under.the adult and children sections. The original Science and Public Policy section remains unchanged. But an.alternative version is suggested at the conclusion. The title suggests a discussion py.about the broader issue of how science in general not just ETS and public policy G.interact rather than further discussion about how ETS science should be 3.evaluated more carefully by scientists and policy makers. The former is the fy.bigger debate and because of it we have the opportunity to position ETS inthe.context of a larger issue to due with sound science reversals in scientific opinion .and unnecessary regulation.,"PES be PHILIP MORRIS MANAGEMENT CORP INTER OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE 120 PARK AVENUE NEW YORK NY 10017 5592 DATE september 25 1996 TO or colin goddard or roger walk or erie windhoek FROM matthew a wink foe RE draft ETS communications resource book have enclosed a revised edition of the message point section of the draft ETS communications resource book given all of the edits to both the first and second drafts which have been requested it seemed only fair to try to incorporate those comments and others provided subsequently and offer you an amended version harmonizing all the recommendations for your consideration wherever possible the revised edition adheres to the spirit and letter of the original following are some of the structural changes anew opening overview sequence of messages is suggested using those already cited throughout the document these are placed at the beginning to offer top line messages which may be supported in subsequent sections references to exposure study research has been moved up to the overview section as have the other arguments which seem related to the underlying weaknesses of the ETS science you'll note that references to personal monitoring studies have been deleted it seems a technical point to explain how the actual exposure data are obtained and a white paper is available elsewhere in the binder to elaborate the section on respiratory effects has been consolidated providing one for alleged effects on adults and another for alleged effects on children and the asthma arguments which were previously a third section are now placed under the adult and children sections the original science and public policy section remains unchanged but an alternative version is suggested at the conclusion the title suggests a discussion by about the broader issue of how science in general not just ETS and public policy a interact rather than further discussion about how ETS science should be 3 evaluated more carefully by scientists and policy makers the former is the by bigger debate and because of it we have the opportunity to position ETS in the context of a larger issue to due with sound science reversals in scientific opinion and unnecessary regulation, 145, 0"

Studies related to the source of nitrite in tobacco snuff.demonstrated that snuff contained bacteria which were able to reduce nitrate to nitrite and that the.amount of nitrite in snuff extracts could be further increased by incubation of the extracts with the.bacteria, Since snuff contains a considerable amount of nitrate, it seems that (1) reduction of nitrate in.snuff to nitrite by bacteria, and (2) nitrosation of certain constituents in snulf by nitrite under acidic.conditions to form mutagenic nitroso compounds are possible mechanisms responsible for the acid-media-..ted mumagunichey of axel? extracts..)d.‘Tobacco snuff, one form of smokeless tobacco, —_—_substances may be swallowed.

He believes.that tumor suppressor gene inactivation may be involved in certain cass of agnogenic myeloid.metaplasia (AMM) and polycythemia vera (P. vera), lesions which involve nonlymphoid.hematopoietic elements. It is noted that the retinoblastoma (Rb) deletion within chromosome.13q occurs with frequencies of 10-20% in both AMM and P. vera and that p53 inactivation.‘causes the conversion to blast crises in the majority of CML patients..The PI presented data that showed oncogenic proteins of simian virus 40 (SV40), adenoviruses 2.and 5, and papillomaviruses bind both Kb and p53 proteins, and that they may induce.‘malignancy by inactivating these proteins. Transgenic mice harboring the SV40 T-antigen gene.develop retinoblastomas wherein the Rb protein is bound to T Ag. The PI has spent almost 15.years studying the organization and expression of the SV4O gene, including the gene for T Ag.and he believes that this may now provide new insights into the role of tumor suppressor genes.in malignancy..His aims will be to investigate the possibility that deletion or inactivation of the Rb gene may.bbe involved in certain hematologic disorders of man, particularly AMM and P vera, and to.demonstrate links between Rb gene inactivation, and then to attempt to induce myeloprolifera.tive or myeloleukemic disorder in mice transplanted with bone marrow cells harboring.transduced antisense Rb sequences. He will also study a variety of other lesions, including.thymomas, choroid plexus tumors, and polycystic kidney disease with renal carcinomas in.transgenic’ mice carrying the SV40 T Ag gene, and assess the possibility of binding and.inactivation of Rb and/or p53 proteins by T Ag..In his section on supporting data, using the Southern study, he suggests that homozygous Rb.deletion has occurred in a patient's disease cells who had manifested AMM. He is currently.performing additional studies on this patient, including an attempt at finding hybridization of.Rb to both chromosomes 13 in lymphocytes but lacking hybridization of Rb in granulocytes..He states this would indicate homozygous Rb deletion in the patient's disease cells. This would.indicate heterozygous deletion, He suggests thatthe diseased WBCs in his patient with, AMM..have sustained homozygous deletion of Rb cells and, should this be borne out by additional.studies, it would suggest that myeloid lineage cells require functional Rb protein for normal.control of proliferation and differentiation, and that homozygous Rb deletion may be a factor.involved in the genesis of certain cases of AMM. If this were the case, it would be an.extremely crucial observation for hematology and would show further the role of Rb.inactivation. He mentions his awareness of some 20 patients of Dr. Jer Wang of Downstate.Medical Center in New York City who have had cytogenetic studies and whose peripheral WBCs.and WBC DNAs have been stored. In one of these patients, a deletion of chromosome 13 was.observed. He expects additional patients to be so identified in that 10-20% of AMM patients.have chromosome 13q deletions. ‘This is extremely interesting..‘The methods appear to be well-written and the PI's extensive experience with the mouse model.is crucial to this study.This is a timely study and if the methods are sound, and Dr. Knudson will be in the best,.position to comment on this matter, then I would rank this proposal as being high in merit (A).‘and, of course, in relevance (A)..HTLidks.CTR-CONFIDENTIAL SUBJECT TO P.O.

He will also study a variety of other lesions including.thymomas choroid plexus tumors and polycystic kidney disease with renal carcinomas in.transgenic mice carrying the SV40 T Ag gene and assess the possibility of binding and.inactivation of Rb andor p53 proteins by T Ag.In his section on supporting data using the Southern study he suggests that homozygous Rb.deletion has occurred in a patients disease cells who had manifested AMM. He is currently.performing additional studies on this patient including an attempt at finding hybridization of.Rb to both chromosomes 13 in lymphocytes but lacking hybridization of Rb in granulocytes.He states this would indicate homozygous Rb deletion in the patients disease cells. This would.indicate heterozygous deletion He suggests thatthe diseased WBCs in his patient with AMM.have sustained homozygous deletion of Rb cells and should this be borne out by additional.studies it would suggest that myeloid lineage cells require functional Rb protein for normal.control of proliferation and differentiation and that homozygous Rb deletion may be a factor.involved in the genesis of certain cases of AMM. If this were the case it would be an.extremely crucial observation for hematology and would show further the role of Rb.inactivation. He mentions his awareness of some 20 patients of Dr. Jer Wang of Downstate.Medical Center in New York City who have had cytogenetic studies and whose peripheral WBCs.and WBC DNAs have been stored. In one of these patients a deletion of chromosome 13 was.observed. He expects additional patients to be so identified in that 1020 of AMM patients.have chromosome 13q deletions. This is extremely interesting.The methods appear to be wellwritten and the PIs extensive experience with the mouse model.is crucial to this study.This is a timely study and if the methods are sound and Dr. Knudson will be in the best.position to comment on this matter then I would rank this proposal as being high in merit A.and of course in relevance A.HTLidks.CTRCONFIDENTIAL SUBJECT TO P.O.

image_0338.png,9,"‘TITLE: ‘Tobacco restriction today, what tomorrow?.BYLINE: § Joe Hawkins.CREDIT: | i$=SPECIAL TO THE BANNER.EST. PAGES: 2.DATE: 01/05/96..pocrD: NSHV22827..SOURCE: Nashville Banner; NSHV.SECTION: News; PAGE: Al3.{Copyright 1996).DATE:.Column: COMMUNITY VOICES.There is an issue currently facing Tennesseans and their.agricultural heritage that is much more complex than would be.realized at first glance. The issue is that of regulatory.jurisdiction of tobacco-related products..For those Tennesseans not involved in agriculture production or.non-tobacco users, the issue vould seem even more insignificant than.to producers. However, this is an issue of tremendous importance to.all Tennesseans.Last year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced a.far-reaching plan to exercise regulatory control over the marketing.and sale of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. The foundation for.this action is based on the FDA assumption that tobacco products are.a delivery device of nicotine..Two major concerns arise from this regulatory initiative. While.the anti-tobacco forces of today's society argue that the tobacco.issue should be addressed without regard to economics, it is.unrealistic to do so.Economics cannot be disregarded for it is the very purpose of the.production process. Tabacco producers do not grow tobacco to create.a ‘drug delivery system.'!

PAGES 2.DATE 010596.pocrD NSHV22827.SOURCE Nashville Banner NSHV.SECTION News PAGE Al3.Copyright 1996.DATE.Column COMMUNITY VOICES.There is an issue currently facing Tennesseans and their.agricultural heritage that is much more complex than would be.realized at first glance. The issue is that of regulatory.jurisdiction of tobaccorelated products.For those Tennesseans not involved in agriculture production or.nontobacco users the issue vould seem even more insignificant than.to producers. However this is an issue of tremendous importance to.all Tennesseans.Last year the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA announced a.farreaching plan to exercise regulatory control over the marketing.and sale of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. The foundation for.this action is based on the FDA assumption that tobacco products are.a delivery device of nicotine.Two major concerns arise from this regulatory initiative. While.the antitobacco forces of todays society argue that the tobacco.issue should be addressed without regard to economics it is.unrealistic to do so.Economics cannot be disregarded for it is the very purpose of the.production process. Tabacco producers do not grow tobacco to create.a drug delivery system. Tebacco producers grow tobacco in order.to pay the bills that in turn help maintain other business activity.Production has through the years passed on a strong work ethic.an ability to provide for a family on limited production resources.land significant economic benefit to the local state and federal tax.revenue. It has clothed fed and educated a significant number of.Tennesseans.It is interesting to note that Tennessee passed a temporary tax in.1925 on tobacco products to fund education.
