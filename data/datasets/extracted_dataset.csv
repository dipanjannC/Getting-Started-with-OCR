Our initiative, which we call Action Against.Access, has ton major elements that will go along way toward ensuring that the.only way to acquire cigarettes legally will be in a face-to-face transaction, where.proof of age can be checked in person. In addition to Philip Morris’ own actions.Such as discontinuance of sampling, we are supporting state lealslation to restrict.vending sales and to require retailer licensing. And itis, in fact, the states to.which Congress has given responsibility for curbing youth access..With this sort of tough action, and the involvement of parents, teachers and.aters to convince minors not fo smoke, we can make great progress in Keeping.kids away from cigarettes, and cigarettes away from kids..As committed as Philip Morris is to preventing youth access to cigarettes, we are.equally committed to ensuring that adult smokers can continue to purchase.cigarettes in a free marketplace.

Mulderig, associate general counsel for Philip Morris..Today’s verdict follows an industry victory on March 18 in the Ironworkers case.in Akron, Ohio, where an L1-member federal jury, looking at claims similar to those in.this case, unanimously determined there had been no fraud or conspiracy among cigarette.manufacturers,.“We believe this verdict should be reversed because it is contrary to the evidence.presented in the trial and contrary to Oregon law,” said Mulderig. “The law of Oregon..requires that the jury must base ifs finding on the sale of cigarettes and the company’s.conduct only after September 1, 1988. The jury was improperly allowed to consider.evidence prior to that date, We believe, for that reason, among others, the verdict should.be overtumed.”.Mulderig noted there was overwhelming evidence presented at trial that the.smoker, Jesse Williams, was well aware of the risks associated with smoking even before.he started at age 21. Even more importantly, Mulderig said, the jury was presented.evidence showing that 11 members of Williams’ family bad quit smoking,.‘The case was brought by the family of Mr, Williams, who started smoking at age.21 while he was in the Army. His family members testified that Mr. Williams, who died.two years ago at age 67, was aware of the well-publicized health risks associated with.smoking, including reports by the U.S. Surgeon General and Congressional warming.labels on cigarette packs, However, the family members testified that he disregarded thet.information, ~.CN.CN.-more-.ON.on._."

The anti..smoking groups and anti-smoking legislation is having a real impact on flat-.tening cigarette sales which, in the end, has a direct impact on us. We are.also now faced with some of the strongest competition ever, in the form of.foreign brands and generics..Since the cigarette market is no longer increasing like it has in the past,.the only way that PM can progress is by capturing more market shares, and the.only way we can do this is by increasing our productivity without increasing.our costs. In other words, we need to do more with less..The company continues to post record revenues and we will feel the positive.affect of record revenues in the share distributed to the DPS plan, which has.also been at record levels. However, the revenues have been due largely to.price increases, not volume increases, and we all know that continued price.‘increases will eventually lead to volume decreases,.In order to adjust to the ‘increasingly competitive market conditions, our stan-.dards for acceptable job performance have also had to continue to increase. I.have and will continue to address Performance standards with each of you indi-.vidually during your appraisal cycle..Poss anyone have any questions about performance standards in general? If you.have any questions concerning the expectations I have of you, I will be glad to.address them with you one-on-one..Up Second area T want to talk about is the salary administration program. You.all know that the PM compensation structure is tied directly to performance..My intent is to help clarify how this connection is made..nw.this year, our Compensation Department collected market data which allows them o>.to compare PM's midpoints and actual average salary levels to other U.S. com- ou.panies. This information paints a very positive picture for PM employees. oo.oO.oo.=.For example, our average exempt salaries are above the 90th Percentile of the Cz.Hay All-Industrial survey.

Therefore, the Cies! law firm stands to gain at cast $1 billion uader the.Hamphrey contract, Each partner inthe firm would earn an average of $9 milion. “Why would the.Attorney General's office with some 300 lawyers on staff paid for with taxpayer dollars need to.hire an outside taw firm and pay them over a billion dollars?” wondered Cooper.Minnesota is only onc of four states that plan to award outside leyul counsel 25% or more of any.tobacco settlement, reports the National Association of Atomey""s Geaeral.

I’m Steve Parrish, Senior Vice.President, Corporate Affairs, Philip Morris Companies Inc. With me is.Richard Verheij, Executive Vice President and General Counsel, UST, Inc..Last week, President Clinton spoke to a group of high school students.in Woodbridge, New Jersey about tobacco. The President directed some of.his comments to the tobacco industry, saying “do not stay outside of and.apart from this debate.” And he went on to say, “Join with us. Do the right.thing.”.Today, Philip Morris U.S.A. and United States Tobacco Company,.the largest manufacturers of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products in.this country, accept the President's challenge. Together, we are proposing.far-reaching and unprecedented federal legislation on the issue of.underage use of tobacco. And we will be actively seeking support for this.initiative..For our companies, this initiative builds on our fundamental.commitment to the propositions that minors should not use — or even have.access to ~ tobacco products. Anyone who violates these principles should.feel the full weight of the law..We offer this comprehensive plan in the hope that all sides in the.debate will set aside the hostility of the past and work together so that kids.will not use tobacco products. We need to act on this issue now, not just.continue the debate about it..Most of us agree on the central issues. Everyone agrees that kids ny.shouldn't use tobacco, And all reasonable people agree that adults should.be able to smoke or use smokeless tobacco if they want to. 2..8..The President has said that we have a right to market our products to =..adults.

Reynolds Tobacco Company, Brown & Williamson Tobacco.Corporation, Lorillard Tobacco Company and the United States Tobacco Company by industry.representative J. Phil Carlton in response to the Commerce Committee tobacco legislation..“The industry cannot support the fundamentally flawed proposal by the Commerce Committee.and cannot take the voluntary actions needed to ensure that such legislation could withstand any.Constitutional challenges that lie ahead..""The Commerce Committee proposal would put at risk all the benefits of the proposed tobacco.resolution. It would also jeopardize the financial viability of the tobacco industry, cause.economic dislocation among those who do business with tobacco companies, impose.astronomical price increases on consumers, create a black market and potentially lead to.prohibition..“The proposal takes aim at the tobacco industry but hits the American people with excessive.and regressive tobacco price increases that will ripple through the economy and wipe out.‘thousands upon thousands of jobs among retailers, wholesalers, distributors, tobacco growers and.others, By more than doubling the price of tobacco products, it also imposes undue financial.hardship on adult consumers..“It cannot serve as the basis for a realistic and comprehensive national tobacco policy.""It is clear that despite the unique opportunity presented by last year's proposed tobacco.resolution, the Administration and some in Congress are more concemed with exacting some sort.of vengeance upon the tobacco industry than in enacting a rational comprehensive solution on.tobacco issues..“It is regrettable that the Administration, which encouraged, participated in and agreed to the.regulatory, financial and civil liability provisions of the June 20 agreement now proposes to.undermine that historic achievement. It is sacrificing the opportunity to implement major public.health policies in order to financially crush a disfavored industry. Congress and the.Administration should put aside politics and provide the leadership necessary for a rational.approach to these issues,.8.3.8.FS.3.3.&.a.""Many of the provisions -- such as the advertising and marketing restrictions and the look-back.surcharges ~ cannot be implemented constitutionally without industry consent. The industry.agreed to these provisions only because they were part of a balanced compromise achieved in last.June's proposed resolution. This balance does not exist in the committee's plan, and therefore the.industry cannot and will not give its assent to it..-more-—."

The code recommends that each billboard company formally.adopt advertising standards to effectively address community concerns.about the advertising of products that may not be sold to minors..The policy encourages individual OAAA companies to ""establish.exclusionary zones which prohibit advertisements of all products.illegal for sale to minors which are either intended to be read from,.or within 500 feet of, established places of worship, primary and.secondary schools, and hospitals."".The code also recommends the establishment of voluntary limits on.the number_of billboards in a market that may carry messages about.products that cannot be sold to minors. The code reiterates a.billboard company's right to reject creative content which may be.deemed in poor taste. It encourages greater diversity of advertised.products and reemphasizes the industry's tradition of donating free.space to worthy community and civic causes. Last year the billboard.industry donated $141 million to charitable organizations and community.initiatives..“We believe voluntary restraint of the number and placement of.Af.messages about products that may not be sold to minors is appropriate 8.3.8.g.~MORE~.Outdoor Advertising Association of America, Inc..Tel: (202) 371-5566 Fax: (202) 371-1284."

It's amajor metropolitan market, an area of sufficient size to do a viable test market..a The area is also fairly representative of the average U.S. smoking population...1. Also, it’s far enough away from previous Eclipse test markets that smokers there are not.likely to be familiar with the product, and we can better gauge objective reaction to the.‘current product and advertising,.Will you fill orders from outside the test market now?.0. Ifwe get orders from outside Texas at present, we will attempt to fulfill orders as our.production capacity allows (in states/localities where such sales are permitted)..By saying Eclipse “is a better way to smoke,” what does it say about your other brands?..a No cigarette is safe, including Eclipse or any of our other brands. All cigarettes present tisk,.but Eclipse may present less risk than any “burn-down” cigarettes,..a Eclipse is a brand that may interest smokers who are concerned about the risks but have.decided not to quit, and who are willing to try a cigarette that lights and smokes a little.differently.7.How many / what states do not allow you to sell/ship cigarettes via direct mail? a.2 Wecan sellin 38 states.

Autemmma — YJayA J. Loy mgrre.SUBJECT SMITTY'S VOLUME INCENTIVE PROGRAM EVALUATION.The following preliminary report utilizes PM's Rapid Fact database to analyze the volume/share.impact of the fist sic weeks of the Smitty's Volume Incentive Program. This program began on May.‘st, executing a thirteen week cycle of rotating Philip Mortis Full Margin promotions with endcap,.temporary display and feature advertisement. Full Margin volume gains achieved during the.promotion cycie can qualify Smitty's fora retailer incentive bonus, which increases with.performance..Note: At the account's request, all promotions are executed trom mid-week (Wednesday through.Tuesday). Since the account's Scanning data is only available for week-end periods (Monday.through Sunday), an individual promotion's firsticumulative response may be understated,.‘Therefore, while the overall program performance can be measured cumulatively, the response of.‘each individual promotion will be evaluated based on the second week of the execution..SUMMARY..* Total Philip Monis Full Margin volume Increased +4.7% during the first six weeks of the Smitty's.Volume Incentive Program, relatve to the pre-promotional tend. This increase, if applied to the.graduated payment schedule offered to Smitty's, would not qualify the account for an incentive.bonus payment (A. minimum of 10% is required for a bonus payment).* Total Industry volume, which was declining significantly versus year-ago levels (-16% as.reported by InfoScan) prior to the start of the Volume Incentive Program, increased 1.3%.during the first six weeks of the program. Both Full Margin and Price Value contributing evenly.to this volume increase..Full Margin experienced a +0.8% volume gain, tied to the increased PM Full Margin business..Price Value volume increased +2.4%, primarily due to Sub-Generic growth and higher coupon.values on Doral ($3.50) and Cambridge ($4.00)..+ The Marlboro Racing Sweepstakes/$2.00 Price Reduction promotion was successful in.generating inoremental brand volume (+32.1%) and share (+7.7 points). Marlboro did not.experience volume’share pay-back in the two weeks following the brand's promotion, despite.the execution of the Merit “Travel Kit"" promotion immediately following the Marlboro event..Mariboro's response to the Racing Sweepstakes/$2.00 Price Reduction promotion executed in.‘Smitty's was similar to the brand's response to the same promotion in a test conducted in.‘Schnucks supermarkets in St. Louis (volume +48.2%, share: 46.4 points)..+  Meri's volume (+8.7%) and share (+0.4 points) increased above the brand's pre-program trends.during execution of the Merit “Travel Kit"" promotion, the second promotion in the program's.thirteen week cycle, For two weeks following this promotion, Mert's volume/share remained.above pre-program trends, indicating that the brand did not experience pay-back during these.woeks..weeks. 8..g..Importantly, Mert experienced sigiicantly higher promotional response during recent Py..Bartlpation in Smits “Shoppers Passport” Program, a requent shopper pragram offering 8..Smamber"" customers scanned savings on selected products In Decombor 1990, Merit 2..experienced a +16,1% volume or +0.7 share point increase with a $2.00-off carton promotion in. x..this program. In February 1991, Merit experencing a volume gain of +62.5% ranslating into 3..+2.5 share points with a simultaneous $0.50-off pack/$2.00-off carton promotion.."

At this point, I have looked at a fair sampling of the.available relevant material. My preliminary conclusions follow..i. The general public may think that health care costs are out.of control.....but it is even worse than that..Health care costs rose more than twice the rate of inflation.for the last few years. Premiums jumped much higher for.individual and small group policy holders who filed sizable.claims; in some instances, the rates jumped so high they may.preclude coverage. According to Nation's Business, when a company.of nine employees filed claims for a dependent's catastrophic.dliness, premiums increased to over $17,000.00 per person per.year...Health care costs in the U.S. are 13% of the GNP, more than.any other industrialized nation, and are expected to hit 15 % by.the year 2000. In 1980, the average employee's medical benefits.cost 5% of payroll; in i990, it's 13%...Business is extremely concerned and believes this is a.serious impediment to remaining competitive in the global market.particularly...The rise in costs is attributed to numerous factors by.aifferent writers’:.o —_- Expanded coverage for substance abuse/mental health now.accounts for 10% to 20% of medical plan costs. 27.states mandated this coverage; this alone is said to.account for a 12% increase in the cost of family.coverage..o Failure of health maintenance organizations and.preferred provider organizations to sustain expected.savings.‘some articles mention that doctors' compensation has not.kept up with inflation in the last five or so years, but did not.indicate whether their compensation was too high to begin with..There are also a number of well documented cases of price-gouging.by providers and endless cases of wrongdoing by doctors..TIMN 385453.CONFIDENTIAL:.MINNESOTA TOBACCO LITIGATION."

Cherry.Roland Hammer has provided me with a tape of the Kool Jazz.Festival television advertising. I have not viewed it yet, but.Roland advises that the changes from last year, if any, are very.subtle..In connection with Industry indiscretions, I read yesterday in.the current Eastern Airlines magazine that Philip Morris is.negotiating with John McEnroe's father (at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind &.Garrison) for a McEnroe endorsement of a Marlboro line of.clothing planned by that company..This would seem to be a confluence of happy items, for although.McEnroe's bush league arrogance and self-conscious posturing may.be a perfect fit for Philip Morris garments (and products.generally) the combination of an athlete, television and the.Marlboro cigarette mark, are something less than a clever dodge.of the '69 Act and the youth provisions of the Advertising Code.A sports promotion hustler quoted in the article said: ""Philip.Morris doesn't want to sell clothes, they want to sell.cigarettes, but they can't advertise them on television. So they.generate a line of clothes with the Marlboro name and symbol; get.McEnroe to endorse and wear them, and they're on television...It's as simple as that""..Indeed it is - as simple as that..S.&.&.a.4.g.ies.ry.————|;.~.We.SHO.JRC/wrh.cc: R.

Sinoo the leaf organization is part of.the Department of Manufacture, I am requesting Mr. McCarthy,.by copy of this memorandum, to extend hie usual cooperation.to you in your efforts to be sure that the targets of our.leaf buy are proper targets for what we are trying te do..What we are trying to do is to reorient ourselves away from.buying atraight-side tobaccos for nonfilter cigarettes and.toward buying leaf-side tobaccos for filter cigarettes. He..do not want this target objective to take second place to a.price average or even to “tar” and nicotine averages. We..are looking primarily for smoking quality for filter cigarettes..I understand that the nature of each crop and the buying of.our competitors have to affect our success in making the kind.of buy we want. Nevertheless, as a first step, I want to be.sure that our targets are clearly communicated from the.Research Departuent to the Department of Kanufacture and Leaf.and that these communications are carried through to the buyers.on the floor. I realise that part of this involves breaking.long-standing habits acquired during our years as a nonfilter.manufacturer and that it probably also involves training.younger men who are not handicapped by the nonfilter hebits.of the past. I vill look to Mr. McCarthy to watch this.closely and I vill look to you to inform me as to the results.in terms of the kind of leaf actually acquired.."

At that time the special write-up of the trin atudies to bring under.one roof all of the work on the twin smoking and health investigations was well.along ~~ on schedule. Considerable progress was made while Dr. Cederl8f was at.Chapel Hill. The first drafts of some parts were revised and considered to be in.Publishable form. Some additional data are to be added up to December 21, 1975.and they hope to have the publication finished by June 20, 1976. They are not.certain how the monograph will be published. The Swedish Tobacco publication was.quite expensive and they were not too pleased with the extent of circulation that.it was getting, 1000+ up to that time have been sent out and more requests are.coming in. If published as a supplement to a journal (which journal?) it would.be expensive but it might get wider circulation. there was no deciaion on place.of publication as yet. Tt was mentioned that the costs of publication were mentioned.in the original proposal. Mention was made that the Swedish tobacco industry might.be approached. (This has been supported as a special project. The basic assumption.was that the smoking and health studies that have been published as progressing.studies and on separate organ and disease systems might be more effective if.reported under one cover and that this might be the tine to prepare such a.publication. The CTR was not enthusiastic about the interpretation but the industry.thought otherwise. This does not mean that CTR is making special grants to its.grantees to write up their researches.).Grant 692. The 1926-1959 Twin Registry has been completed and the raw.data have been submitted to CrR. This includes numbers of twins by sex, zygocity.and age groups with much ancillary data on life style, symptomatology, place of.residence, marital status, etc. This data is also being grouped as a population.data source as well as both MZ and DZ twins. ‘They are thus considered as.individuals and to this has been added the twin that did not have a counterpart in‘.the twin registry.

Future testing will include these blends as well as new prototypes..The purpose of this testing will be to determine how similar new prototypes are.to current reconstituted blends..Training for this panel will be conducted April 2 to 4. During the training.period, each panelist will receive one pack of 100% RL150B and one pack of 100%.RcB. He will be instructed to faniliarize himself with the degree of difference.between these blends and to consider this difference to be a 5 on the 7-point.difference scale. By rating this difference a5, panelists will have room on.the scale to rate prototypes as more different (6 or 7) or less different (1..to 4).

Bible.Earlier this week, we discovered that an ingredient supplied by.Celanese which is used in the manufacture of filter material was contaminated with.a bacteria. The manufactured product containing this material gave off an.unpleasant odor, which is how we detected the problem initially. We immediately.ceased production, cleaned out the tanks and pipes containing the material, and did.not resume production until a substitute material was obtained from another.vendor We also put a hold on all of the affected product that was within our.control..Ongoing testing revealed that the presence of the bacteria triggered a.chain reaction which led to the formation of a byproduct by the name of methy!.isothiocyanate (MITC), a toxic substance. MITC can cause various forms of.discomfort, including eye, nose and throat irritation, dizziness, coughing, and.wheezing, if inhaled in sufficient quantities..We have no evidence that any of the affected product reached the retail.distribution channel. However, it is possible that some of it did, and we cannot.easily or quickly verify that fact. Accordingly, because we are dealing with a toxic.substance, we decided out of an abundance of caution to institute a nationwide.consumer recall. As a result, we are recalling in the U.S. domestic market every.pack of cigarettes, both at retail and wholesale, of all of the brands shown on the Z.attached list. That recall was launched at 3:00 p.m., which is within one day of our 8.becoming aware of the scope of the problem. A copy of the press release announcing =.the recall is attached. We will also be running newspaper ads starting tomorrow. &.g.g.Fy.7."

In some Sections distribution for Basic is far lower February Nielsen indicates only 42%.distribution, with reductions in distribution from January to February in 9 Sections and 2 Regions..In my original correspondence to you, I asked you to attain a minimum of 60% retail distribution for.Basic. [am now asking you to set a retail distribution objective for Basic of 754% by May 31, 1993..Obviously, that means you will need distribution in both Retail Masters and non-Retail Masters accounts.where we currently have 67% and 39% distribution respectively..To help you achieve this distribution objective, you are authorized to offer gratis on a one time basis to.retail accounts not currently carrying Basic. AS before, you may offer 10% gratis on up to 20 cartons.sold in (ie., maximum of 2 gratis cartons per retail account.) Gratis cartons should be expensed at the.wholesale price of Basic using Promo Code 324J..In addition, please remember to fully leverage the other tools you have for merchandising and promoting.Basic. Attached is a listing of Section allocations and orders placed for the B2G1F deals. If your.Section no longer has inventory of old Basic packaging, you may use your remaining allocation of.B2G IF deals to wrap three new packs/cartons together.In those accounts where a permanent merchandising position does not exist, placement of a separate.display under the Basic ‘Temporary Merchandising Program is imperative. "" Attached is a listing of.Section allocations and orders placed for the temporary pack and carton merchandising fixtures. These.units are no longer on backorder Please order your full allocation to help you achieve and maintain a.‘competitive display presence as soon as possible..‘To help in this effort, we also plan to drop an FSI and direct mail program to help leverage Basic’ s.position versus other deep discount brands in June, Details will be forthcoming..Finally, please note that our current allowance structure makes Basic’s price from manufacturer to.wholesaler competitive with RJR's major deep discount entries.

Winokufoe=—.RE: Draft ETS Communications Resource Book.Thave enclosed a revised edition of the Message Point section of the draft ETS.Communications Resource Book. Given all of the edits to both the first and.second drafts which have been requested, it seemed only fair to try to.incorporate those comments and others provided subsequently and offer you an.amended version, harmonizing all the recommendations, for your consideration..Wherever possible the revised edition adheres to the spirit and letter of the.original. Following are some of the structural changes:.Anew opening ""Overview"" sequence of messages is suggested using those.already cited throughout the document. These are placed at the beginning to.offer top line messages which may be supported in subsequent sections..* References to exposure study research has been moved up to the Overview.section as have the other arguments which seem related to the underlying.weaknesses of the ETS science. You'll note that references to ""personal.monitoring studies"" have been deleted. It seems a technical point to explain how.the actual exposure data are obtained, and a white paper is available elsewhere.in the binder to elaborate..* The section on respiratory effects has been consolidated, providing one for.alleged effects on adults and another for alleged effects on children. And the.asthma arguments which were previously a third section are now placed under.the adult and children sections..* The original Science and Public Policy section remains unchanged. But an.alternative version is suggested at the conclusion. The title suggests a discussion py.about the broader issue of how science in general, not just ETS, and public policy = G.interact rather than further discussion about how ETS science should be 3.evaluated more carefully by scientists and policy makers. The former is the fy.bigger debate and, because of it, we have the opportunity to position ETS inthe.context of a larger issue to due with sound science, reversals in scientific opinion ©.and unnecessary regulation.."

Wiegand Evaporator (DMT C & I #55).Objective: To ensure repeatable CIP’s and determine the most cost and time effective.cleaning scheme to maintain reliable operation of the Wiegand evaporator system..The new sprayballs (hole size increased from 5/64"" to 7/64"") were installed in the #1 finisher.on 11/16/93 An attempt was made to test the sprayballs on 11/18, however the flow valve to.the sprayballs (FV-81-554) had a bad solenoid, The valve was repaired and the sprayballs were.tested during the CIP on 11/24. The larger holes in the sprayballs increased the flow capacity.through the finisher sprayballs from 16 gpm to 25 gpm which prevented backup in the Wiegand.evaporator Also, the cycling in the feed balance tank level control valves was significantly.reduced. The next step is to make adjustments to the feed balance tank level control scheme to.further minimize water makeup into the system These adjustments will be made at the next.possible CIP, depending on the CIP schedule prior to the Wiegand being taken down for the.‘work to address vibration and Frank McFee’s schedule Once the level control scheme has been.modified, testing will be completed to measure the effect of the changes on the chemical.concentration. If the changes are successful, efforts will begin to reduce the CIP cost by.reclaiming the chemicals, reducing the time for the CIP, optimizing the CIP frequency, and.evaluating alternate citric acids. Completion of CHECK stage is dependent on the timetable and.efforts to address the vibration problems with the Wiegand.9930045955."

Johnston.C.0.R./C.E.0..Dear Sir,.I wrote to the company you represent perhaps a year ago with the suggestion you.‘begin to look into the idea of phasing out your tobbacco product and replace your.acreage/production along the line of more environmentally consciencious adaptation-.ie-sorghum, cotton, and the like. Instead I have seen more aggressive, slick ~~.marketing toward the less educated, lower income, and youth. Take the enclosed ~.ad for instance. Could one dare to specylate what this woman (or any of her ¢.contemporaries) looks like after 60 years of smoking? I know. My mother died of.enphysema. Her face was wrinkled and hard. Her fingers were yellow with tar stain..Her breathing was labored and forced- eventually she had to rely on a respirator.for oxygen. She couldn't climb stairs and we had to deliver her to the door of.wherever she was going. She wasted away for 25 years, rendered useless by the.years of cigarettes. How do you think I feel, having bought cigarettes for her.when she wasn't able to get them, herself?.What kind of message is being sent? I see a reinvention of Camel packaging, before.Cancer and Lung disorders prevailed. Please. Stop the madness. Everyday, more.and more people light up their first cigarette. They think it's cool, sophisticated,.even arrogant. They don't realize the internal damage they are reaping. They don't.realize they are smoking 1 or 2 packs a day and that they stink like the thing.in their mouth. There is a very strong movement to suppress cigarettes altogether.‘and I have been within those ranks since my mother died. My family got the.smessage. My Father, brother, and I alliquit. We recognized what was happening..So many others do not. How can you feel good~about yourself; knowing~the-destruction.you are doing to society? Please, don't send me some token letter how you are.implementing choice, it is much more diabolic than that. I guess you could say I.was lucky, having survived a car accident and knowing how dear this life we've been.given and to make constructive use of my time on earth. Nicotine that you put in.your product is highly addictive. People on life supports go on smoking but not.under their own power. I won't go on. You've heard it all before. But know this-.people who are angry with the cigarette companies are getting even madder. And we >.will not be silenced. When you made cigarettes addicting you took away our choice. 8.And now you must recognize your guilt. Do everyone a favor and cease making these — @.cigarettes before (you? and-) others become DECEASED. Everything in this world 8.is finite and should be treated with that in mind..Anne French.P.O.

Obiective: Produce novel systems with planar substrate..'B. Results; The unit from Marco Machine (case and motor drive unit) was received.and tested. There were adjustments to the drive pin (polyethylene sleeve to..increase diameter and increase traction) and to the take up pulley (Increased.‘spring clutch tension) to make the drive have a stronger pull on the tape. The.first two heater units (macor ceramic bases) from Alabama Research have been.received. The Ti02 ceramic base units are delayed to at least 2/4/93 because of.problems with the diamond grinding tooling. The first unit will have the.batteries inside and the circuit board taped to the back of the unit. The tape.with longitudinal fibers improves burn-through and tape breakage. New tapes.with thinner mats are underway..if.‘C. Conclusions: The components for the first unit are in house. Assembly and.testing are underway. The next priority is to develop thinner, more flexible..and stronger tape as the unit operation seems satisfactory..D.

image_0477.png,5,"Lung Cancer Screening by Breath Analysis.Executive Summary.It is proposed to develop a lung cancer screening system and procedure that will permit.routine and inexpensive early stage detection of lung cancer in the general population. Breath.analysis of human exhaled air by an ultrasensitive laser detection device (LDD) will be used to.quantitate lung cancer biomarkers. Prototype LDD systems will be used in a U.S. Clinical Trial.conducted under an FDA-approved protocol to document the safety and effectiveness of lung,.cancer screening by breath analysis. The proposed program will be accomplished in three.phases: 1 - Pilot clinical study, 2 - Clinical trial and FDA approval, and 3 - Commercialization..It is anticipated that early stage detection will decrease lung cancer mortality significantly in.both smokers and non-smokers..Background.Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States, accounting for an..estimated 160,000 deaths in 1997/1] Lung cancer is difficult to cure - the overall 5-year survival.rate is only 13%!l, since metastasis has often occurred prior to diagnosis. Although the.survival rate increases to 65% (Stage I) and 41% (Stage II) for non-small cell lung cancer cases’.(approximately 75 to 80% of primary lung cancer cases) detected in an early stage when the.disease is still noninvasive!*!, present screening procedures (chest X-rays, sputum cytology.tests, etc.) are not sufficiently reliable to be used routinely and thus have had little impact on.reducing mortality“. A simple, effective, and inexpensive lung cancer screening procedure is.needed for widespread early stage diagnosis in order to permit early stage treatment before.invasive cancer develops..Cigarette smoking is estimated to account for 80 to 90% of all lung cancer cases!*/,.However, the remaining 10 to 20% incidence is due to other causes such as radon and.occupational hazards (asbestos, efc.), In addition, not all smokers contract lung cancer -.cigarette smoking is a risk factor for individuals who are genetically susceptible to the.disease!5], Ideally, genetically susceptible individuals should learn their status at the earliest.possible time in order to prevent lung cancer by reducing behaviorial and environmental risks..In the absence of routine genetic susceptibility markers, the next best approach is to diagnose.lung cancer disease at an early stage, thereby enabling high-risk individuals and their PS.physicians to make informed decisions about therapy and, where appropriate, lifestyle changes 8.such as cessation of smoking. s.x.3.3.such as cessation of smoking.."

Objective: To investigate appropriate binder systems to be used as an altemative to.the current processes..‘B. Results: The physical testing of various reconstituted tobacco sheets made in the.Cast Leaf Lab has been completed, ‘The data indicates that guar binder produces.much stronger sheets than pectin or pectn/guar binders, an that the preliminary.subjective screening with handmade cigarettes did not show any significant advantage.of pectin over guar. Both binders were found to be subjectively acceptable..Additional sheet quantities with 8 parts guar and varying levels of DAP (0, 1.5 and.2.5) were made in the Cast Leaf Lab for machine made cigarettes: and further testing.3.(CI, subjectives)..A method that improves the processability of a “hybrid” BL/RL sheet in the.laboratory has been developed, and the plans are to scale-up the procedure in the.Cast Leaf Lab during the week of 3/4 for further testing (physicaly/subjectives). The.method involves the treatment of a portion of the tobacco feedstock (20-40 percent).with DAP/NH,OH as per RCB followed by an acidification step prior to adding the.binder with the balance of the tobacco feedstock to form a combined slurry for.‘casting..-.‘Several SIVA formulations were made in the Cast Leaf Lab in an attempt to match.the RLB/RLTC (50/50) subjectives for TSA. The subjective screening of these.formulations is currently in progress by Flavor Technology personnel with handmade.cigarettes. Attempts to improve the SIVA sheet physicals by increasing the guar.binder level from 4 to 6 parts in the formulation containing a 50/50 mixture of 120.and 400 mesh size TSA feedstock were not successful, This tobacco blend was.found to require 10 parts guar to produce a very good sheet, free of cracks. The.problems may be due to the tobacco particle size distribution in the blend, This.problem is currently being investigated,.Other binder systems currently under investigation are locust bean gum and starch..Cc.

Objective: To determine the precursors of MS TSNA..B Results: A nicotine amino acid ester, t-butyl 2-(3-pyridinyl)-1-.pyrrolidinylacetate (1), has been applied to a high nitrate, low.alkaloid burley filler for the purpose of determining whether this.material could serve as a model of bound nicotine. When the.corresponding cigarettes were smoked, no significant differences.in MS TSNA deliveries were found between these cigarettes and the.control.Work was continued to develop methods for determination of *‘C-NNN.and **C-NNK. ‘This methodology is needed to determine if MS '*C.ISNA formation occurs in cigarettes containing **C-nicotine.Standard '*C-NNN, ''C-NNK and '*C-nicotine were successfully.separated on an Ultrasphere ODS column using a MeOH/0.2%.triethylamine phosphate (pH 7.2) gradient. A radioactivity.detector was utilized. '*c activity between 0.1 and 0.5 nCi was.detectable under these conditions Also, work was carried out to.expand previously developed TLC methology to the isolation of an.NNN/NNK fraction from 2R1 cigarette smoke which was spiked with.labelled NNN and NNK.An RL prepared from burley (Bu) CEL + sugars on Bu base web (BW).was smoked for MS TSNA deliveries. The sugars (glucose 7%, fruc~.tose 6.5%, and! sucrose 0.9%) were added’ to mimic the sugar levels.found in oriental (Or) CEL When compared to a similar RL without.added sugars, the TSNA levels found in MS smoke from BuCEL +.sugars on BubW were reduced by amounts similar to reductions.obtained from 1/2 BUCEL + 1/2 OrCEL on BuBW as reported earlier.Reductions in NNN (60-62%) and NNK (52-53%) were almost identical.for the two samples, while the sugar addition produced a 14%.reduction in NNK as compared to a 38% reduction for the mixed).solubles RL. When considered together with FTIR-EGA evidence, the.data suggest that the reduction in TSNA is due to a reaction.Product (or products) formed from sugars and soluble ammonia.PD Bilans: Since the t-butyl ester (1) did not result in TSNA forma-.tion the corresponding free acid will be prepared and the experi.ment repeated to determine if esterification may have prevented.oss of the carboxyl group When methods development is complete,.cigarettes will be prepared from filler containing '*c-nicotine.‘The cigarettes will be smoked and the method’ used to determine if.cigarettes will be prepared from filler containing ‘‘C-nicotine nv.The cigarettes will be smoked and the method! used to determine if i}.NNN and NNK are formed from nicotine during smoking Also planned x.@..i=]..1s S.reductions occur due to TSNA decomposition.wien."

Few studies have reported the relationship between passive smoking (PS) in earty ile and the risk of.lung cancer This study was done fo evaluate the risk of female lung cancer trom PS. especially that during Ghidhood:.and adolescence..Methods. Using household exposure to tobacco smoke as an estimate of PS, a1 1 pated case-control study was.conducted in Harbin, China. We interviewed 114 female primary lung cancer cases, aged 30-69 years, an tnew.hospital-based controls. The controls were non-cancer patients, selected from the same hospital as the cases, and.matched on age (+ 5 years), residential area and smoking status over their Metime. Thete were $9 pairs who ever.‘smoked and $5 paits who never smoked. Information on PS was collected by residence for each ot the following.erin: 0-6, 7-14, 15-22, 23-20 and 31-69 years..Fe: 5: Household PS signticatly increases the risk of female ung cance for thse exposed at ages 22 ot younger.who have ever smoked. The risk was also increased for those non-smoking pais whien exposed under the age of 15..years, Exposure to maternal smoking al ages 14 or younger increased the risk by about 170% (adds tatin OA 2 7.‘95% confidence interval {CI}: 1 49-488), but not to paternal smoking (OR 1 40, 95%CI. 092-2 50). The risk was.highest for those exposed under the age of seven (OR 3.46, 9$%Cl; 1.80-6.65) and was aso signiicant at ages 7-14.(OR 3.08, 95°C: 1 62-5.57) and 18-22 (OR 3.10, 85%CI. 1 52-6.31) years. Under the age of 23 years the OR.Increased with amount of PS{P< 0,001), Ot note. the OR inal five exposure periods for non-smoking pairs were smlar.to those forall 114 pairs studied,..Conclusions.

After acid treatment, nitroso compounds in the amount corresponding to the.nitrite concentration were detected. The mutagenic potency of the acid-treated extracts was consistent with.the content of nitroso compounds generated. Formation of nitroso compounds and the mutagenic activity.under acidic conditions was inhibited by ascorbic acid. The results indicate that a nitrosation process was.involved in snuff extracts during acid treatment. Studies related to the source of nitrite in tobacco snuff.demonstrated that snuff contained bacteria which were able to reduce nitrate to nitrite and that the.amount of nitrite in snuff extracts could be further increased by incubation of the extracts with the.bacteria, Since snuff contains a considerable amount of nitrate, it seems that (1) reduction of nitrate in.snuff to nitrite by bacteria, and (2) nitrosation of certain constituents in snulf by nitrite under acidic.conditions to form mutagenic nitroso compounds are possible mechanisms responsible for the acid-media-..ted mumagunichey of axel? extracts..)d.‘Tobacco snuff, one form of smokeless tobacco, —_—_substances may be swallowed.

Lynch MD..DATE: 7/13/90..SUBJECT Application #2986, ""Tumor Suppression Genes in Human Hematologic.lalignancy and Transgenic Mice,"" Prabhat K Ghosh PhD.Secondary Reviewer.Panticule’ attention to sae on gchanisms by which hematologic malignancies develop, with.particular attention to tumor suppressor genes, and their role in human malignancy. He believes.that tumor suppressor gene inactivation may be involved in certain cass of agnogenic myeloid.metaplasia (AMM) and polycythemia vera (P. vera), lesions which involve nonlymphoid.hematopoietic elements. It is noted that the retinoblastoma (Rb) deletion within chromosome.13q occurs with frequencies of 10-20% in both AMM and P. vera and that p53 inactivation.‘causes the conversion to blast crises in the majority of CML patients..The PI presented data that showed oncogenic proteins of simian virus 40 (SV40), adenoviruses 2.and 5, and papillomaviruses bind both Kb and p53 proteins, and that they may induce.‘malignancy by inactivating these proteins. Transgenic mice harboring the SV40 T-antigen gene.develop retinoblastomas wherein the Rb protein is bound to T Ag. The PI has spent almost 15.years studying the organization and expression of the SV4O gene, including the gene for T Ag.and he believes that this may now provide new insights into the role of tumor suppressor genes.in malignancy..His aims will be to investigate the possibility that deletion or inactivation of the Rb gene may.bbe involved in certain hematologic disorders of man, particularly AMM and P vera, and to.demonstrate links between Rb gene inactivation, and then to attempt to induce myeloprolifera.tive or myeloleukemic disorder in mice transplanted with bone marrow cells harboring.transduced antisense Rb sequences. He will also study a variety of other lesions, including.thymomas, choroid plexus tumors, and polycystic kidney disease with renal carcinomas in.transgenic’ mice carrying the SV40 T Ag gene, and assess the possibility of binding and.inactivation of Rb and/or p53 proteins by T Ag..In his section on supporting data, using the Southern study, he suggests that homozygous Rb.deletion has occurred in a patient's disease cells who had manifested AMM. He is currently.performing additional studies on this patient, including an attempt at finding hybridization of.Rb to both chromosomes 13 in lymphocytes but lacking hybridization of Rb in granulocytes..He states this would indicate homozygous Rb deletion in the patient's disease cells. This would.indicate heterozygous deletion, He suggests thatthe diseased WBCs in his patient with, AMM..have sustained homozygous deletion of Rb cells and, should this be borne out by additional.studies, it would suggest that myeloid lineage cells require functional Rb protein for normal.control of proliferation and differentiation, and that homozygous Rb deletion may be a factor.involved in the genesis of certain cases of AMM. If this were the case, it would be an.extremely crucial observation for hematology and would show further the role of Rb.inactivation. He mentions his awareness of some 20 patients of Dr. Jer Wang of Downstate.Medical Center in New York City who have had cytogenetic studies and whose peripheral WBCs.and WBC DNAs have been stored. In one of these patients, a deletion of chromosome 13 was.observed. He expects additional patients to be so identified in that 10-20% of AMM patients.have chromosome 13q deletions. ‘This is extremely interesting..‘The methods appear to be well-written and the PI's extensive experience with the mouse model.is crucial to this study.This is a timely study and if the methods are sound, and Dr. Knudson will be in the best,.position to comment on this matter, then I would rank this proposal as being high in merit (A).‘and, of course, in relevance (A)..HTLidks.CTR-CONFIDENTIAL SUBJECT TO P.O.

This experimental approach was used because.‘the STST cell line is a well-characterized in vitro adipocyte differentiation system and the pSV3nco plasmid.contains the early region of the SV40 genome and a selective marker, GIB resistance. Cell clones containing.stably integrated pSV neo which expressed T antigen were isolated in G418-containing medium, Most ofthese.cell clones differentiated poorly. However, several clones retained the ability to efficiently differentiate into.‘adipocytes, and with these cll cones, it was established that adipocyte differentiation markedly repressed.‘T-antigen expression, The differentition-speciic repression of T-antigen expression id not result from a loss.of proliferative potential associated with terminal differentiation, because it was observed in adipocytes that.ould be restimulated to proliferate. In such cells, restimulation of cell growth induced ceactivation of.‘T-antigen expression, Repression of T-antigen expression was also demonstrated during differentiation of SV40.‘T-antigen-immortalized human keratinocytes. These results establish that the process of cellular dilferentiation.‘can repress T-antigen expression in at least two distinct biological systems..‘During the process of differentiation, numerous changes in pSV3neo-transfected clonal cell lines, T-antigen expression.cellar gens expression gveor Since viral nes are depen- was found tobe markedly repressed during aipocytedifec.Gent on certain hoo ewes for thelr expression, ferent entiation, The repression of antigen was reversible when.Stion can also affect the expression of viral genes.

Little is known about.regulation of its synthesis. We confirm that ATIII is synthesized by isolated.rat hepatocytes, and that its synthesis is not iltered by direct feedback of its.complexes with proteinases. Neither is hepatocyte synthesis of ATI altered.by supernatants from macrophages cultured in the presence of ATIII-.proteinase complexes. However, culture of macrophages with fibrinogen.fragment D resvits in production of a factor(s) in the macrophage.supernatants which stimulates hepatic fibrinogen synthesis, as previously.described, and also stimulates the synthesis of ATII and aj-proteinase '.Inhibitor (01 PD.

Culture of macrophages in the presence of bacterial endotoxin also !.results in release of @ factor(s) into the medium which stimulates the same j.changes In hepatocyte protein synthesis. These results show for the first.‘time a mechanism by which synthesis of ATIII can be regulated during.coagulation and fibrinolysis..INTRODUCTION.In order to maintain fluidity of circulating blood, yet allow for effective.coagulation when required for hemostasis, the plasma levels of endogenous pro- and.anticoagulant proteins must be regulated within narrow llmits. Relatively litte is.known, however, about the mechanisms by which synthesis of most coagulation proteins.is modulated. Antithrombin Il (ATH) is an anticoagulant protein which Is the molor.inhibitor of activated clotting factors, particularly thrombin and IXa. ATH binds to.serine proteinases to form inactive ATilI-proteinase complexes (1). Binding is enhanced.In the presence of heparin. Much indirect evidence exists that ATIN is synthesized in |.the liver.

Our data suggest that both lesions play a role in.cach end point examined. The relative importance ofthese lesions is dependent on the end point studied.as well as the fluence used, For SCE induction and the activation of alternative sites of replicon.initiation, the (6 4) lesion appears to play a predominant role, while for the thymidine ineonporation.studies the (6~4) lesion appears to play the predominant role at low fluences while the role of the (5-6).lesion increases at higher fluences..‘There has been much debate concerning the ——_pre-mutagenic lesion (Wood, 1985).

image_0155.png,9,"Smoking in Adoles.ence.A number of articles recently published in.pediatric and public health journals have.called attention to the rather slarming in-.cidence of cigarette smoking in teen-agers.and the broader implications of this prac-.tice to daily living patterns and life adjust-.‘ment of this group. A recent survey of over.800 adolescents of both sexes disclosed that.starting about age 14 or 15, smoking by boys.becomes progressively more common until.about age 18 when 90 per cent are smoking.at least occasionally. The ineidence in girls.is somewhat less but at age 18 about 60 per.cent are smoking to some degree, Positive.associations have been found between regu-.Jar or daily smoking and a high frequency.of visits to the school health room, frequent.absences from classes and a school perform.ance of grade C or lower. Smoking does.not appear to be causally related but seems.more an indication of a way of life...Other factors previously have been de-.fined as related to a high incidence of smok-.ing in adolescence. Teen-age smokers, in.comparison to nonsmokers, spend more..= time watching TV and going to movies and.2 dances. They are mre likely to own cats.P.76 volume zzzii, number 1 GP.TIMN 280238."

PAGES: 2.DATE: 01/05/96..pocrD: NSHV22827..SOURCE: Nashville Banner; NSHV.SECTION: News; PAGE: Al3.{Copyright 1996).DATE:.Column: COMMUNITY VOICES.There is an issue currently facing Tennesseans and their.agricultural heritage that is much more complex than would be.realized at first glance. The issue is that of regulatory.jurisdiction of tobacco-related products..For those Tennesseans not involved in agriculture production or.non-tobacco users, the issue vould seem even more insignificant than.to producers. However, this is an issue of tremendous importance to.all Tennesseans.Last year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced a.far-reaching plan to exercise regulatory control over the marketing.and sale of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. The foundation for.this action is based on the FDA assumption that tobacco products are.a delivery device of nicotine..Two major concerns arise from this regulatory initiative. While.the anti-tobacco forces of today's society argue that the tobacco.issue should be addressed without regard to economics, it is.unrealistic to do so.Economics cannot be disregarded for it is the very purpose of the.production process. Tabacco producers do not grow tobacco to create.a ‘drug delivery system.'! Tebacco producers grow tobacco in order.to pay the bills that in turn help maintain other business activity..Production has, through the years, passed on a strong work ethic,.an ability to provide for a family on limited production resources,.land significant economic benefit to the local, state and federal tax.revenue. It has clothed, fed and educated a significant number of.Tennesseans.It is interesting to note that Tennessee passed a temporary tax in.1925 on tobacco products to fund education. That tax was made.permanent in 1927, and in 1994 resulted in an excess of $84 million.for education. No other product can compete with that contribution,.just as no other product can offer the return on investment to the.Producer. If the demand for any product provided the production.incentive of tobacco, producers would respond..Alternative crops are often suggested, however, if a major shift.to any other production was successful without major marketing.network changes for that production, chaos and bankruptcy would be.the zeeult fox many..Aside from economics, another major concern arises from this FDA.7TI1686-0058."

They also ask for smoking rooms or sections.to be set up in the workplace if possible,.Furthermore, they call on corporations to measure the density of.floating particles in the alr at least twice a day, and to limit the accumulation.to 0.15rmg per cu, meter or less..nx.o.The guidelines alsa urge the absolute contro! of second-hand cigarette.Lael.Pry.smoke if there are any pregnant women or employees with respiratory.trouble present.

But he didn't tell.delegates — and a nationwide TV audience ~ about his tobacco income..Gore said Thursday that his father and mother also continued to grow tobacco on their farm in.Carthage, Tenn., for several years afier the death of his sister. who had started smoking when she.was 13 and died at the age of 45.“I did raise it all my life."" Gore said. ""I did plant it, spray it, cut it, spike it, strip it. sell it. etc"".Eventually he said, his parents quit growing the crop and he started surrendering the annual.tobacco allocation lease check he had ""continued to receive —_for several years, even after.her death,”.Gore brought the Democratic convention to stunned silence Wednesday mght when he.interrupted a political attack on Republican rivals to speak about his siste’s death and her.intimate “final hours"" conversations with him..As he recounted the story, Gore's mother, Pauline. watching in a skybox, took off her glasses..and wiped tears from her eyes. Gore said Thursday he had ""considered"" but rejected telling.the convention about his family’s involvement in raising tobacco..“I don't know: it just seemed like it might be better to focus on what was most important about.this story "" he said, ""Up until soon before the speech. I was unclear as to whether I could do it.”.TI3081-9620."
